## Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge: Tech Blog

# Description
User can view any blogs on the main page and click them to see the comments. Both the post and comments will show who posted them.
If a user would like to create their own blog they can sign up to create an account or login to an existing one. Once logged in they now have access to a dashboard for posting blogs. They can also go to other blogs and comment on them leaving their name and a date.
The user then can logout and end their session or a timeout exists on the session as well.
